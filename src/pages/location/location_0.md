description: The game's world is divided into six open-world regions of varying size. These are White Orchard, the Royal Palace in Vizima, Velen and Novigrad, Skellige, the Kaer Morhen valley, and the duchy of Toussaint. These regions are independent of one another and travel between them is only possible by fast-travel or story progression, while travel within a certain region is possible by any means. Velen and Novigrad, while considered two distinct regions on the world map, are in fact combined into one large region that can be traversed without fast-travelling.
