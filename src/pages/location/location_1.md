title: Kaer Morhen

Kaer Morhen valley is an abandoned area in the mountainous region known as Hertch in northeastern Kaedwen, where the prehistoric sea was located many millennia ago. Currently, the only known "inhabited" structure in the valley is the limestone keep of Kaer Morhen, home of the witcher's School of the Wolf, and surrounding places. The Gwenllech river flows through the valley.
