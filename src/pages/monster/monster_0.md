description: The Witcher's code roughly categorizes monsters as creatures of no sentience who are deemed a threat to human society. Because of that, a monster slayer has to attempt to reason with an opposing creature that bears any form of intelligence before he attempts to remove it. It's not unheard of a Witcher resolving issues with aggressive creatures by reasoning with them, nor is it rare for them to engage in mortal combat with entities that exhibited advanced intelligence simply because the parties in question where malicious and threatened human lives.
